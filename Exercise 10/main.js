// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
//just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
//Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
// Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, 
// create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

//Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
//Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. 
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
