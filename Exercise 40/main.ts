// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title, 
// and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. 
// Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks 
// on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, 
// add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
